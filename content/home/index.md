# Gabriel Loiseau

{{ image(url="picture.jpg", alt="Me", no_hover=true, end=true) }}

Hello! I am a third year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at [Hornetsecurity](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/) and [Inria Lille](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-luniversite-de-lille), advised by [Marc Tommasi](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/tommasi/), [Damien Sileo](https://sileod.github.io/) (Inria [MAGNET](https://team.inria.fr/magnet/) team), [Damien Riquet](https://driquet.info/) and <a href="#">Maxime Meyer</a> (Hornetsecurity). My research focuses on the implementation of utility-preserving automatic text anonymization methods.
The project is funded by a [CIFRE](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_industrielle_de_formation_par_la_recherche) aggreement, a French government-funded program promoting collaborative research between companies and research labs. 

Prior to my PhD, I worked on designing a compact deep neural network with state-of-the-art performance for phishing detection at [Vade](https://www.vadesecure.com/) (which got acquired by Hornetsecurity in 2024).
During my Msc. I also worked on deep learning explainability for music generation, in the [Algomus](http://algomus.fr/) group at the CNRS.

You can find more information on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-loiseau/) profile.

## Works
My publications are available on the dedicated [publications](@/publications/_index.md) page and through my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_Ck-tkAAAAJ) profile. A comprehensive list of my presentations can be found on the [talks](@/talks/_index.md) page, and you can explore the public software libraries I've developed and contributed to on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gabrielloiseau).

## News
- **September 2025.** Our Tau-Eval paper has been accepted to *EMNLP 2025*.
- **June 2025.** I'll be presenting our new evaluation framework for text anonymization at the 15th *Atelier sur la Protection de la Vie Privée* in Chasseneuil-du-Poitou (June 9-12).
- **June 2025.** New preprint available! We've developed a comprehensive evaluation framework and Python library for assessing text anonymization methods.
- **April 2025.** Presenting at *NAACL* (April 29 - May 4) on our latest PrivateNLP paper.
- **March 2025.** Paper accepted at PrivateNLP! Our work introduces a novel reinforcement learning approach for authorship obfuscation.
